By enabling ARC with the new Apple LLVM compiler, you will never need to type retain or release again, dramatically simplifying the development process, while reducing craches and memory leaks. The compiler has a complete understanding of your objects, and releases each object the instant it is no longer used, so apps run as fast as ever, with predictable, smooth performance.</p></blockquote>","keywords":null,"cover":null,"content":null,"text":"A note for book Pro Multithreading and Memory Management for iOS and OS X<br>ARC is summarized in Apple’s own words:ARC in Objective-C makes","link":"","raw":null,"photos":[],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"iOS","slug":"iOS","count":9,"path":"api/tags/iOS.json"},{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","count":13,"path":"api/tags/Programming.json"},{"name":"ARC","slug":"ARC","count":1,"path":"api/tags/ARC.json"},{"name":"Rules","slug":"Rules","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Rules.json"},{"name":"Objective C","slug":"Objective-C","count":4,"path":"api/tags/Objective-C.json"},{"name":"Coming soon...","slug":"Coming-soon","count":3,"path":"api/tags/Coming-soon.json"}]},{"title":"关于 SequenceType","slug":"learning_iOS/SequenceType","date":"2017-01-25T07:47:23.000Z","updated":"2017-01-29T02:27:33.000Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/learning_iOS/SequenceType.json","excerpt":"<p>Coming soon…<br>","keywords":null,"cover":null,"content":null,"text":"Coming soon…<br>从 Array 开始","link":"","raw":null,"photos":[],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"iOS","slug":"iOS","count":9,"path":"api/tags/iOS.json"},{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","count":13,"path":"api/tags/Programming.json"},{"name":"Coming soon...","slug":"Coming-soon","count":3,"path":"api/tags/Coming-soon.json"},{"name":"Sequence","slug":"Sequence","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Sequence.json"},{"name":"type","slug":"type","count":2,"path":"api/tags/type.json"}]},{"title":"Debug Print in iOS Programming","slug":"learning_iOS/debugPrint","date":"2017-01-15T02:29:44.000Z","updated":"2017-01-29T02:27:34.000Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/learning_iOS/debugPrint.json","excerpt":"<p>自定义 print 输出<br>","keywords":null,"cover":null,"content":null,"text":"自定义 print 输出<br>请先参考王魏的博客 Swifter","link":"","raw":null,"photos":[],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Coming soon...","slug":"Coming-soon","count":3,"path":"api/tags/Coming-soon.json"}]}]}
